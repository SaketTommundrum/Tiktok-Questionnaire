## How to Add Background Images

1. **Find suitable images** for each answer. Recommended sources:
   - Unsplash.com (free high-quality images)
   - Pexels.com (free stock photos)
   - Your own photos or screenshots

2. **Image Requirements:**
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Size: 800x600 pixels or larger (will be automatically resized)
   - Aspect ratio: Landscape or square works best
   - Style: Professional, relevant to the topic

3. **Save images with these exact names:**
   - `masters-degree.jpg` - Education/graduation related
   - `work-experience.jpg` - Office/workplace scene
   - `bachelors-degree.jpg` - University/college scene
   - `team-leadership.jpg` - Team collaboration/leadership
   - `sql-database.jpg` - Data/technology/coding scene
   - `automation.jpg` - Technology/automation/robots
   - `business-analytics.jpg` - Charts/graphs/business meeting

   - `dashboards.jpg` - Data visualization/screens
   - `bellevue-wa.jpg` - Bellevue skyline or office buildings
   - `travel.jpg` - Airport/plane/travel scene
   - `salary-growth.jpg` - Success/growth/money concepts

4. **Optimization Tips:**
   - Keep file sizes under 500KB for faster loading
   - Use tools like TinyPNG.com to compress images
   - Test images on different screen sizes

## Example Image Search Terms:
- Masters degree: "graduation cap diploma university"
- Work experience: "modern office workspace team"
- SQL database: "data server technology code screen"
- Business analytics: "business charts graphs dashboard"
- Python statistics: "python code programming data science"
